Hi! My name is Melchior. I am a software engineer that specializes in web development. I love open source software, and am always learning new things that suit my profession. I have a strong foundation in the PHP ecosystem, and specialize in TALL-stack (Tailwind, Alpine, Laravel and Livewire) development. My professional experiences include working for both one-man companies and enterprise scale teams. 

Things that interest me most about web development are often system architecture and database performance related. I have a passion for clean code and love to refactor to make things more readable and easier to maintain. 

Finally; I am a passionate worker that goes all in on team spirit, and believes that good things are better when enjoyed together.
